Mathematical Insight
The number of digits d in a number n can be determined using the logarithm base 10:

d = ⌊log₁₀(n)⌋ + 1

For N!, you want to find:

d = ⌊log₁₀(N!)⌋ + 1

Using properties of logarithms:

log₁₀(N!) = log₁₀(1) + log₁₀(2) + log₁₀(3) + ⋯ + log₁₀(N)

Thus, you can sum the logarithms of all integers from 1 to N, then apply the formula to find the number of digits.
