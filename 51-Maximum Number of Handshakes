/*
To maximize the number of handshakes, each person should shake hand with every other person in the room. For the first person, there would be N-1 handshakes.
For second person there would N-1 person available but he had already shaken hand with the first person. So there would be N-2 handshakes and so on. 
So, Total number of handshake = N-1 + N-2 +â€¦.+ 1 + 0, which is equivalent to sum of first (n-1) natural numbers i.e  ((n-1)*((n-1)+1))/2 = ((N-1)*N)/2 .
(using the formula of sum of first N natural number i.e (n*(n+1))/2)
