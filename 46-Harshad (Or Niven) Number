/*
An integer number in base 10 which is divisible by the sum of its digits is said to be a Harshad Number. An n-harshad number is an integer number divisible by the sum of its digit in base n.
Below are the first few Harshad Numbers represented in base 10:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 18, 20………
