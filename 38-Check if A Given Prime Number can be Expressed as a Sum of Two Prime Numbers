/**
 * Efficient approach:
 *
 * Except for 2, all prime numbers are odd. 
 * And an odd number can never be expressed as the sum of two odd numbers,
 * because odd + odd always equals an even number.
 *
 * Therefore, an odd prime cannot be written as the sum of two odd primes.
 * This means that if a prime number 'n' is to be represented as the sum 
 * of two primes, one of them must be 2.
 *
 * So we only need to check whether (n - 2) is prime.
 * If (n - 2) is prime, the answer is "Yes". Otherwise, "No".
 *
 * Example:
 * For n = 19:
 *   Check whether 19 - 2 = 17 is prime.
 *   Since 17 is prime → answer is "Yes".
